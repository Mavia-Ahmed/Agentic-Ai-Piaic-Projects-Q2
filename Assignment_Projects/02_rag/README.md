Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

### Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**, which combines retrieval-based approaches with large language models (LLMs) to produce contextually accurate and enriched responses. The notebook focuses on integrating external data retrieval with generative AI, showcasing how to build robust AI-powered solutions.

### Key Features
- **Information Retrieval:** Fetches relevant data from external sources to provide context.
- **Generative AI Integration:** Combines retrieved data with a language model for more informed and accurate responses.
- **Practical Example:** Step-by-step implementation of a RAG system using modern tools and libraries.

### Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language for the implementation.
- **LangChain:** A framework for creating applications powered by LLMs and retrieval-based systems.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and visualization.
- **Vector Databases:** To store and query embeddings (if applicable).

### How to Run

LangChain Function Calling

### Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of **function calling** using the LangChain framework. Function calling enables language models to execute specific tasks programmatically by invoking functions dynamically based on user input. The notebook provides an interactive walkthrough of how to set up and utilize LangChainâ€™s function-calling capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Function Execution:** Leverages LangChain to call pre-defined functions based on input prompts.
- **LLM Integration:** Showcases how language models can collaborate with external functions for task automation.
- **Practical Example:** A hands-on demonstration of implementing and testing function-calling workflows.

### Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for the project.
- **LangChain:** A framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs).
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Provides an interactive environment for running and testing the code.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mavia-Ahmed/Agentic-Ai-Piaic-Projects-Q2/edit/main/Assignment_Projects/03_function_calling.git
